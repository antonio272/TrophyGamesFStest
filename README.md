I have built a game using PHP and MySQL for the backend, following the MVC architecture and incorporating CRUD functions. The game is designed to cater to both administrators and regular users/players. On the front-end, I have utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Leaflet to create an engaging user interface with numerous animations and game features.
In the game, the final destinations have been set to the coordinates of Tivoli Gardens (55.6746686, 12.5657116) to provide a shorter and faster testing experience.

As an administrator, you can log in using the email: admin@gamestation.com and password: 12345678. This will grant you access to administrative features and controls.

As a user/player, you can log in using the email: player1@gamestation.com and password: 123456789. This will allow you to play the game and experience the interactive features.

Hosting Instructions:
1) Ensure you have XAMPP installed on your localhost.
2) Place all the game files and necessary folders directly inside the "htdocs" directory of your XAMPP installation.
3) Start the Apache server in XAMPP.
4) Open your web browser and enter the following URL: http://localhost/. This will access the files located at the root of your localhost.
